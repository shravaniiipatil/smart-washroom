# Smart-WashroomðŸš½
  Older adults, particularly those at risk of heart attacks, require special attention to prevent health crises from going unnoticed. This smart washroom/bathroom system is designed to enhance safety for senior citizens by incorporating technology that monitors movement within the bathroom.

# INTRODUCTION

  Old age is a sensitive phase; elderly people need care and comfort to lead a healthy life without worries and anxiety. Lack of awareness regarding the changing behavioral patterns in elderly people at home leads to abuse of them by their kin. It is true that the older a person gets, the weaker their body system becomes. As a result, older people are more susceptible to illnesses. Blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes, and arthritis are just a few ailments that older people may get exposed to if they are not suitably cared for in their old age.

# PROBLEMðŸ˜¨

	Many time we heard that someoneâ€™s relative went to washroom / bathroom in the morning and half or one hour later his home members tried to call him/her then they found he/she was not responding. After broking the door, they found he/she was dead due to heart attack. Medically it is proved after severe heart attack if patient is treated within an hour, he/ she can cure. But, if such patient stuck in the washroom/ bathroom, which is locked from inner side, home members unaware of the situation and they are unable to support to the patient for treatment.

# EXPLANATIONðŸ«€

	1. The project's primary objective is to ensure the safety of senior citizens who are prone to heart attacks. The system activates when the senior citizen enters the bathroom.
	2. If there is no movement detected for 10 minutes, the system triggers a loud alarm. This feature serves as a safety net to call for immediate assistance in case of a health emergency, such as a heart attack.
	3. If person in was still due to other reason for 10 mins and if he/she came to know alarm is ringing then he/ she can immediately stop the alarm by pressing internal switch indicating that there is no any hurdle.   

# CONCLUSIONðŸ’¡ 

	By tailoring this smart bathroom project to the specific needs of senior citizens prone to heart attacks, you can help provide a safer and more secure bathroom environment for this vulnerable demographic.
